    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3] = 'Lux';
      //console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = '3';
      console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = '4';
      console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
      //let person2 = person;
      //console.log(person, person2);
      //person2.name = 'Caleb';
      //console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

      console.log(person, person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      let person4 = {...person};
      person4.name = 'Ben';
      console.log(person, person4);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
